# Language purpose/genesis
## Java

Java was largely developed to make developing cross platform easier. Java was originally developed for digital TV ecosystems which consisted of a variety of small computers like remotes or TVs. When Java launched it boasted "Write Once, Run Anywhere." Javas syntax was intentionally similar to C and C++, which were familiar to most developers at the time. 

## Swift

Somewhat unlike Java, Swift was initially developed for Apple products, which though they could vary widely by hardware, were somewhat similar from an OS perspective. In many ways Swift was developed to create an easier to use and more familiar alternative to Appleâ€™s other language Objective C, which was widely disliked by many in the development community for years. Swift takes respected aspects of many other languages and implements them in a simple and familiar way which helps prevents common errors like null pointers.
