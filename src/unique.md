# Unique Features
## Java

Java had a number of rare features at its launch like its high level portability. Java is also known by many for its overuse of classes and verbosity. 

## Swift

Swift’s uniqueness oddly comes in its similarities to other languages. Swift combines features of programming languages which potentially have never been implemented in a single programming language by default. No other languages simultaneously have objects, structs, and optionals  and can be compiled alongside Objective C. Swift’s optionals accompany a helpful syntax for avoiding Null pointers. Swift’s use of optionals are frequently compared to Haskell. Swift also borrows some syntaxes from python and has features from several other languages.
