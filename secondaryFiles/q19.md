### Functional programming. Does the language support functional programming?
Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. This approach eliminates side effects like local or global states. In Java 8, functions became first class. That is, the functions can be treated as arguments of other functions, return functions and store functions as objects.
Java Example code:
```Java
public static Integer compute(Function<Integer, Integer> function, Integer value) {
    return function.apply(value);
}
```
This shows how the higher-order function is used. The function is taken in as an argument. It is able to compute the function with the Integer value. Then we can use this function to do something
```Java
public class MyClass {
    private static Integer invert(Integer value) {
        return -value;
    }
    public static Integer invertTheNumber(){
        Integer toInvert = 5;
        Function<Integer, Integer> invertFunction = AwesomeClass::invert;
        return compute(invertFunction, toInvert);
    }

}
```
Swift can also take function as input

```Java
func saveMeFromMadness(elements: [Int]) -> Int {
 var sum = 0
 for element in elements {
  sum += element
 }

 return sum
}
```
We define a function  as inline closure, which makes the expression very concise and powerful. Swift also has some implementations like
```Java
let addFive = { $0 + 5 }
addFive(7) // Output: 12
```
