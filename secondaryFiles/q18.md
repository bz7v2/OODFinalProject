### Procedural programming. Does the language support procedural programming?
Procedural means structured and this is how we started the programming language. For OOP the language need to be procedural. Java is designed to be an OO language, however, everything inside a class or function is procedural. More specifically, the code can be procedural except the beginning as:
```Java
class DateApp {
public static void main(String args[]) {
        fun1();
        fun2();
        fun3();
        fun4();
        fun5();
	â€¦

}
}
```
Everything else done by this app can be written in pure procedural programming.
As we see, Procedural (or imperative) programming is primarily concerned with decomposing problems into a sequence of actions. In Swift the same thoughts can be applied. The data tends to be highly decoupled from the functions that operate on it. For some applications, this can be an advantage for the design.
