### Multithreading. Threads or thread-like abilities, How is multitasking accomplished?
For Java, thread has the following life cycle: New, Runnable, Waiting, Timed Waiting, Terminated (dead). A new thread can be created by implementing a Runnable Interface. A simple syntax of the run() method is
```Java
public void run( )
```
Secondly, a thread object is instantiated.
```Java
Thread(Runnable threadObj, String threadName);
```
After that, the start() method is called to execute the run() method.
```Java
Void start();
```
A good example is shown as
```Java
class RunnableDemo implements Runnable {
   private Thread t;
   private String threadName;

   RunnableDemo( String name) {
      threadName = name;
      System.out.println("Creating " +  threadName );
   }

   public void run() {
      System.out.println("Running " +  threadName );
      try {
         for(int i = 4; i > 0; i--) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + threadName + ", " + i);
            // Let the thread sleep for a while.
            Thread.sleep(50);
         }
      }catch (InterruptedException e) {
         System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " interrupted.");
      }
      System.out.println("Thread " +  threadName + " exiting.");
   }

   public void start () {
      System.out.println("Starting " +  threadName );
      if (t == null) {
         t = new Thread (this, threadName);
         t.start ();
      }
   }
}

public class TestThread {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      RunnableDemo R1 = new RunnableDemo( "Thread-1");
      R1.start();

      RunnableDemo R2 = new RunnableDemo( "Thread-2");
      R2.start();
   }   
}
```
In this script, the thread is instantiated in start() function, and the run() function is defined to be the work to be done. In the main function, an instance is created by implementing the RunnableDemo Class, and the start() function is called to start the task.

There are also several ways to implement multithreading in Swift.
NSThread can creates new thread for a task, and it is executed by calling the start method
```Java
var myThread = Thread(target: self, selector: #selector(self.myThreadMainMethod), object: nil)
myThread.start()
```
Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is another method used to achieve multithreading. Basically it provides a way to queue the tasks for dispatch.
```Java
let queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_HIGH, 0)
dispatch_async(queue) {
}
```
The example above shows the task it assigned to the global queue. GCD provides three main types of queues. The main queue runs on the main thread and is a serial queue. Global queues: concurrent queues that are shared by the whole system. There are four such queues with different priorities : high, default, low, and background. The background priority queue is I/O throttled. Custom queues: queues that you create which can be serial or concurrent. These actually trickle down into being handled by one of the global queues. For the global concurrent queues, the priority is not specified. Instead the Quality of Service is specified, and GCD will determine the priority given to the task.
