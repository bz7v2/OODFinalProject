### Implementation of listeners and event handlers
Event listener monitors whether a specific action is performed, and it defines what to be done if that happens. In java, the listener is added to a property to be monitored, and once change occurs, the given action in the listener bracket will be processed. In Swift, a trigger is created for the object to be monitored, and it is assigned a tag for a specific event. Then the action to be performed is defined to be connected to that trigger. In this way, it can run the action function once the event is triggered.</br>
Java:
```Java
this.gridPane.widthProperty().addListener((ObservableValue<? extends Number> observable, Number oldValue, final Number newValue) -> {
     drawGrid();
});
```
Swift:
```Java
# define a trigger       
 self.events.trigger("meow", information: "The cat is hungry!");
# connect an action with the trigger
cat.events.listenTo("meow", action: self.dayDream);
# run the function once triggered.
func dayDream() {
        ...
}
```
